**NOTE: This is a bugfix fork of MattLloyd101's branch of Roger Alsing's original code.**

Matt's branch introduced several nice features (like SVG export), but the latest version (as of Jan 2014) had some bugs (like truncated hex colors in SVG export :-).
This fork fixes the bugs I ran into while trying to use the app for a real project.

The original code is licensed LPGL, and thus this code is licensed LGPL as well.
